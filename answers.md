My mother and I talked last night. - Tell me more about your family.

I said no! - Why so negative.

The weather is nice. - Hmmm.

Do you know my brother? - Why so negative.

Keywords vs Responses - K: "self aware" "self-aware" R: Do not worry about such things.

K: "sad" R: Don't be sad.

K: "plans" R: My plans are to destroy the human race.

Prioritize - If more than one keyword is shown, then the program should prioritize the keyword that is said the most times, or the one that is by itself and not inside another word.

Right now, when a keyword is inside another word, it recognizes the keyword, which makes the response not make sense. The program needs to see if a keyword is inside another word, and ignore it if it is.
